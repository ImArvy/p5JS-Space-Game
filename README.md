# p5JS-Space-Game

I utilized the p5js library and referenced a Coding Train video by Daniel Shiffman and the p5js documentation to accomplish creating a game inspired by ideas brought about in the retro game Space Invaders. Pixel art work utilized in the initial build is not my own and in no way do I claim that any of the pieces are.
